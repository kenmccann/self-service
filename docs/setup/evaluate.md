## Evaluate your Environment

Before you start the deployment of your Aqua Platform it will be necessary to gather some initial details about the environment that will be secured by Aqua. This may involve a number of steps to either discover or validate parameters which will be used to determine how Aqua will be deployed. 

Items that need to be evaluated are below, be sure to make note of the following:

1. Verify the cluster node count, vm’s, number of images, largest image size, etc..
2. Refer to [Aqua Sizing guide](https://docs.aquasec.com/v2022.4/release-information/sizing-guide/) – Make note for deployment considerations
3. Networking review for communication to SaaS -> Referenced [here](https://support.aquasec.com/support/solutions/articles/16000119367)
4. Verify responsible teams – Make notes for RBAC
5. SSO integration considerations
6. SIEM tooling preparation – gather relevant information and include relevant teams
