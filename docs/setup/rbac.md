## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Aqua Platform supports the creation of user roles which can be used to limit the access to Aqua based on rules and policies that you define. This needs to be configured by your organization and will be defined by your requirements for user access. 

 Refer to our handy [RBAC Guide](../setup/rbac-guide/rbac-guide.md) to help with completing the following: 
 
 1. Create preliminary basic Application scopes
 2. Create Permission Sets for role assignments
 3. Assign Permission Sets and Application Scopes to roles
 4. Map Roles to organizational groups in SSO Group Mapping
