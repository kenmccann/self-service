## Before you start 

Aqua Security is designed to prevent and protect against Cloud Native security attacks and vulnerabilities. To get the maximum benefit from your Aqua platform it will be necessary to understand a number of key concepts related to software development, security practices, operations and modern cloud infrastructure. The Aqua platform will touch many different teams and we would recommend ensuring appropriate knowledge is present in your organization before deploying Aqua. This section will illustrate the various teams and knowledge which are recommended for maximum success. 

## Aqua Resources for your journey

Aqua provides all customers with a number of resources which are available for you to use. These are all provided as part of your Aqua Security subscription and can be accessed using your Aqus login which should be provided by the Aqua adminsitrator or owner at your organization. An overview of each resource is given here along with the link to access the resources. 

## The Guided Path illustration

Your onboarding journey with Aqua is illustrated as an easy to follow map with all of the instructions and tasks that you will need to complete laid out to follow. Aqus experts have used their experience of onboarding hundreds of customers on the Aqua platform and this knowledge is now available for you to use in your own deployment. We have set out each of the steps that should be completed in the correct order and have highlighted additional training, labs or other resources for you to use on your journey with us. 

The Guided Path will start with the introductory steps that every customer will need to complete and will then move onto more advanced topics as you gain confidence with the platform and as you integrate your business systems with the Aqua platform. You should aim to follow the path as closely as possible abd avoid skipping ahead in order to ensure that all of the steps are completed. 

Depending on your Aqua platform subscripton you may have entitlement to use the Shift Left, Shift Right or both Shift Left and Shift Right. Aqua advises tha you complete the Shift Left activities first if you have purchased both Shift Left and Shift Right subscriptions. 

Your Guided Path is a graphical representation of the various steps needed and you will start at the beginning of the path. Follow the activities in sequence to reach the end of each phase of the Path and ensure that all items are completed as you progress.
