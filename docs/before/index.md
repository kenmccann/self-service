# Before you Start

Welcome to the Aqua family! In this section we would like to help you get familiar with some of the useful tools within Aqua. We will be walking you through your initial login into your Aqua User Interface along with where to go to get licensing information, how to add users to your portal, and introduce you to some brief videos on how to use the product. 

This section consists of a number of sections which are listed below.

1. Aqua User Interface (UI)
2. Customer Success Portal
3. Support Portal


### Welcome Email

Signing into your User interface will be the first access point to your new environment. The technical owner should have received a 'Welcome email', that will include some important information that you will need to keep handy for your Aqua Deplopyment. This will include IP addresses, Gateway URL, and your Cloud Account number. Your Welcome email will look similar to this image below. If you did not receive your welcome email, please let your Account Executive know as you will need that information later on in the deployment.
