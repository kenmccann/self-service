# Before you Start

Welcome to the Aqua family! In this section we would like to help you get familiar with some of the useful tools within Aqua. We will be walking you through your initial login into your Aqua User Interface along with where to go to get licensing information, how to add users to your portal, and introduce you to some brief videos on how to use the product. 

This section consists of a number of sections which are listed below.

1. Aqua User Interface (UI)
2. Customer Success Portal
3. Support Portal


## Aqua User Interface

In this section, we will be discussing the first few steps you need to take in order to gain access and login to your Aqua User Interface or otherwise called your UI. Your Aqua UI is where you be able to view your scan results, create policies and integrate with other tools you may have. We will go into all those in details but right now we will cover these topics below.

1.	Welcome Email (Needs updating)
2.	Signing into your new platform
3.	Adding Additional users
4.	View licensing in your User Interface

### Welcome Email

Signing into your User interface will be the first access point to your new environment. The technical owner should have received a 'Welcome email', that will include some important information that you will need to keep handy for your Aqua Deplopyment. This will include IP addresses, Gateway URL, and your Cloud Account number. Your Welcome email will look similar to this image below. If you did not receive your welcome email, please let your Account Executive know as you will need that information later on in the deployment. 

### Signing into your new Platform

The first task we would like you to do is make sure you have access to your new environment. The Technical Owner should have received a 'Welcome email', with some important information and the ability to sign in. 

As the technical owner, you will have to navigate to [cloud.aquasec.com](cloud.aquasec.com) and reset your password using the email that was used. Once reset, you will have the ability to login and add additional users to your environment. 

### Adding Additional Users

Once signed in, you may then add new users by following these steps below:
 
 1. Navigate to the Mega Menu found on the top Left left (9 little squares)
 2. Scroll down to 'Account Management'
 3. Click on 'Add New' (Top Right). 


Once you click on Add New, you will be able to add each user you would like to have access by entering in their email and decide whether or not they will be an Administrator (this can always be changed later on).

As an Aqua customer you may want to setup SSO. Setup for SSO can be found [here](https://support.aquasec.com/support/solutions/articles/16000111637-saml-setup-instructions).

### View licensing in your User Interface

When starting or even during your Aqua journey you may want to look at what you are licensed for. You can check your license by going to the Mega menu found on the top Left left (9 little squares) -> Account Management -> Licenses & Plans (left hand plane) -> Enterprise Licenses

Here you will see be able see your active license count.


## Customer Success Portal

The [Customer Success Portal](https://success.aquasec.com) is where you can go to find useful information such as your user management, licenses, documentation, our support portal, and Aquademy.

As the Technical Owner, you can create new users in the Aqua Success portal and grant/modify permissions for existing users.  We’ve compiled this guide to assist you with exploring the resources available to you and your team.

### The Aqua Success Portal

Our [Success Portal](https://success.aquasec.com) is the best starting point for exploring our online resources.  Once logged into the success portal you have one-click access to our [Documentation](https://docs.aquasec.com), [Support](https://support.aquasec.com), and [Training](https://aquademy.aquasec.com) portals. 

It is important to note that your success portal account is associated with your email address, and is different from your account used to log into the Aqua UI/console.   

If you have never logged in or have forgotten your password, please use the "Forgot Password" link on the success portal login page to generate a password reset email.


### User Management in the Success Portal

Our Support team has written some Knowledge Base articles regarding how to manage users in the Aqua Success portal.  Follow the link below for step-by-step instructions on the process, with screenshots! 

#### Add, Update, and Block users 

https://support.aquasec.com/support/solutions/articles/16000104357-user-management-in-the-aqua-success-portal 

 
#### Creating new Technical Owners 

You may notice that you don’t have the option to create other Technical Owners; this is by design as a security precaution.   

That said, we understand that more than one Technical Owner per account may be needed.  In order to ensure the provisioning of new Technical Owners is properly documented, please open a support ticket with the request and our team will be glad to assist you. 

 #### Add a user with a different domain

By default, you are only able to add new users with the same domain suffix as the original Technical Owner.  This is by design as a security precaution. 

If you need to add a user with a different domain suffix, please open a support ticket with the request and our team will be able to assist you with this.  Once the first user with the new domain has been created, the domain suffix will be available for subsequent new users. 

### License management in the Success Portal

License management in the Success Portal 

As the Technical Owner, you (and any other users with the “license” permission) can view your purchased Aqua license keys via the Success portal.  Simply navigate to https://success.aquasec.com/#/licenses (you can also access this page when logged into the Success portal by clicking on the User icon in the upper right and selecting “Licenses” from the drop-down menu).   

For instructions on how to apply your new license key(s), please refer to https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/settings-licenses#section-add-an-aqua-security-software-license
