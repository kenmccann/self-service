## Customer Success Portal

The [Customer Success Portal](https://success.aquasec.com) is where you can go to find useful information such as your user management, licenses, documentation, our support portal, and Aquademy.

As the Technical Owner, you can create new users in the Aqua Success portal and grant/modify permissions for existing users.  We’ve compiled this guide to assist you with exploring the resources available to you and your team.

### The Aqua Success Portal

Our [Success Portal](https://success.aquasec.com) is the best starting point for exploring our online resources.  Once logged into the success portal you have one-click access to our [Documentation](https://docs.aquasec.com), [Support](https://support.aquasec.com), and [Training](https://aquademy.aquasec.com) portals. 

It is important to note that your success portal account is associated with your email address, and is different from your account used to log into the Aqua UI/console.   

If you have never logged in or have forgotten your password, please use the "Forgot Password" link on the success portal login page to generate a password reset email.


### User Management in the Success Portal

Our Support team has written some Knowledge Base articles regarding how to manage users in the Aqua Success portal.  Follow the link below for step-by-step instructions on the process, with screenshots!

#### Creating new Technical Owners 

You may notice that you don’t have the option to create other Technical Owners; this is by design as a security precaution.   

That said, we understand that more than one Technical Owner per account may be needed.  In order to ensure the provisioning of new Technical Owners is properly documented, please open a support ticket with the request and our team will be glad to assist you. 

 #### Add a user with a different domain

By default, you are only able to add new users with the same domain suffix as the original Technical Owner.  This is by design as a security precaution. 

If you need to add a user with a different domain suffix, please open a support ticket with the request and our team will be able to assist you with this.  Once the first user with the new domain has been created, the domain suffix will be available for subsequent new users. 

### License management in the Success Portal

License management in the Success Portal 

As the Technical Owner, you (and any other users with the “license” permission) can view your purchased Aqua license keys via the Success portal.  Simply navigate to https://success.aquasec.com/#/licenses (you can also access this page when logged into the Success portal by clicking on the User icon in the upper right and selecting “Licenses” from the drop-down menu).   

For instructions on how to apply your new license key(s), please refer to https://docs.aquasec.com/docs/settings-licenses#section-add-an-aqua-security-software-license
