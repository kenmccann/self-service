# Shift Right

Welcome the Guided Path for Aqua Shift Right customers! This is your complete guide to all of the steps that you will need to complete in order to successfully onboard with the Aqua Platform.  

The Shift Right package is for customers who are looking to secure their cloud subscriptions, Kubernetes clusters, and containerized workloads.

1. CSPM
2. KSPM
3. Workload Scanning
4. CWPP
5. Drift Prevention
