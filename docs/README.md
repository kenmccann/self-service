# Aqua Professional Services Handbook 

Welcome to Aqua Security's handbook for Professional Services.

This is the repository home for Aqua Professional Services, where you will find multiple projects intended to facilitate the delivery of Professional Services consultancy to a customer.  

Here we document our service offerings, procedures, best practices and helpful guides to best prepare for a successful engagement with Aqua Security customers.

## Overview

This entire repository is built on top of the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) platform and all documentation is produced in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

MkDocs requires a recent version of Python and the Python package manager, `pip`, to be installed on your system.

You can check if you already have these installed from the command line:

```
$ python --version
Python 3.8.2
$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
```

### Installing Material for MkDocs
```
pip install mkdocs-material
```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/), [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) and [Python Markdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/). Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately.

For more information, please visit the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
