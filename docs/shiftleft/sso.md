Due to the architectural design of Aqua some additional configuration will be necessary (along woth some work by the Aqua support team) to set this up initially. The steps below should be completed in the order specified to ensure that your SSO is configured correctly. 

1. Coordinate with SSO team
2. Open a ticket with Aqua Support asking to integrate SSO  
3. Follow instructions for SSO integration here
4. Provide the necessary SAML Provider information to support team
5. Test and verify SSO Auth is correct
