## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Aqua Platform supports the creation of user roles which can be used to limit the access of a user to specific functions.  This can be done using rules and policies defined by your organization. 

 Refer to our handy [RBAC Guide](../setup/rbac-guide/rbac-guide.md) to help with completing the following:

 1. Create preliminary basic Application scopes
 2. Create Permission Sets for role assignments
 3. Assign Permission Sets and Application Scopes to roles
 4. Map Roles to organizational groups in SSO Group Mapping
