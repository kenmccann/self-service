When deployed on local clusters, i.e., clusters on which Aqua Platform is not deployed, the Aqua Cloud Connector establishes a secure connection to the Aqua Platform console, giving Aqua Platform remote access to resources on the local clusters. The local resources supported are registries for container images and serverless functions; for simplicity, we will refer to all as images. Once you deploy the Connector on a local cluster, you are ready to go! You can create a new image registry integration and test its connectivity to ensure the deployment is successful. Once the integration is saved, the Aqua Platform console can access your registry and perform standard Aqua Enterprise operations, such as searching the registry for images and auto-pulling them.

Work needed This document is a bit wordy: cut down Videos explaining Image Assurance policies Explanation of custom policies Explanation of application scoping rules Image Assurance Overview Aqua Enterprise provides full lifecycle security for: Containerized applications, running either on Linux or Windows hosts VMware Tanzu applications, running on Linux hosts; see also below The overall goal of full container lifecycle security is the deployment of applications that ensure the security of your applications' operations, data, and computing infrastructure. Aqua Image Assurance covers the first part of the container lifecycle: image development. The Image Assurance subsystem detects, assesses, and reports security issues in your images. Next, Aqua provides different forms of risk management, based on your preferences: Aqua can block the deployment of containers based on images with security issues. Alternatively, it can help you mitigate the risk of deploying such containers based on images with known risks. Through Risk-based Insights, Aqua can also identify running containers based on images with vulnerabilities and known exploits \"in the wild\". This section describes the Image Assurance activities performed by Aqua throughout the image development lifecycle. Tanzu applications Terminology differences VMware Tanzu Application Service (TAS) is the new commercial name for the Pivotal Application Service (PAS). Some Aqua Enterprise artifacts related to Tanzu Application Assurance (UI, etc.) still reflect the older name or Cloud Foundry (CF). The Tanzu equivalent of an image registry is a VMware Tanzu Application Service blobstore. A Tanzu application is called a droplet. In Aqua Enterprise, you can define and configure VMware Tanzu Application Assurance Policies in the same manner has you define and configure Image Assurance Policies for containerized applications. Support limitations Aqua Enterprise support for VMware Tanzu applications has certain limitations with respect to support for containerized applications. See Platform Support Differences and Limitations, Tanzu Application Service (TAS). These limitations apply to Image Assurance as well as runtime (deployed containers). Image Assurance activities Image Assurance comprises the following main activities. Click on the links for further information. Static scanning of your images for static security issues (vulnerabilities, sensitive data, and malware) and assessing their importance Dynamic scanning of your images, using Aqua Dynamic Threat Analysis (DTA) . DTA runs container images in a safe and isolated sandbox environment, and monitors behavioral patterns and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as malicious behavior and network activity. (DTA is not available for VMware Tanzu applications.) Evaluation of image compliance with the Image Assurance Policies (or Tanzu Application Assurance Policies) that you define and configure Reporting the results of the scanning and compliance evaluation in the Aqua UI, as well as to third-party SIEM (security information and event management) systems integrated with Aqua Risk management as appropriate for your organization's security requirements Image Assurance Basics Image Assurance Policy components An Image Assurance Policy consists of: Application scopes and Additional scope criteria: define set(s) of images to which the policy will be applied; see Policy Scope Actions: what Aqua will do if an image fails the Image Assurance Policy Exceptions: items that evaluation of the Image Assurance Policy should ignore Controls: individual tests that are evaluated on the results of image scans Actions You can select any or all of the following actions to be taken for an image if a given Image Assurance Policy fails: Create an audit message when image failed: An entry is added to the Audit log, indicating the reason the policy failed Fail the Aqua step in CI/CD: An image build that is scanned during the CI/CD process will be marked as failed, and cannot be pushed to a repository Mark failed images (VMware Tanzu applications) as non-compliant: At runtime, if the Container Runtime Policy for the container with this image includes the control Block Non-compliant Images, the Enforcer will prevent the container from running the rejected image. Exceptions You can select any or all the following exceptions to the evaluation of the Image Assurance Policy: Ignore vulnerabilities that have no available fix: If selected, vulnerabilities for which there is no known solution will not trigger policy failure. Ignore vulnerabilities that were published in the last [nn] days: Provides a \"grace period\" of 1-999 days for vulnerabilities that are less likely (due to their newness) to have exploits. Ignore specific vulnerabilities: If selected, you can list any number of specific vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2019-1234) on separate lines. Ignore vulnerabilities and malware found in specific path: If selected, you can list any number of paths (resources) on separate lines. Vulnerabilities and malware found in those paths will not cause policy failure. The paths must be entered in gitignore syntax (e.g., /projects/proj1. Ignore vulnerabilities found in base image: If selected, current policy ignores vulnerabilities found in its base image layers and fails if vulnerability controls are triggered for vulnerabilities found in an image\u2019s non-base layers. Configure the Default Image Assurance Policy Aqua comes with Default Policies that are always present and cannot be deleted. The Default Image Assurance Policy comes with no controls enabled and applies to the Global Application Scope .

Important Consult the organization's security team when mapping out the permission sets, roles and application scopes to align administrative and security teams towards a common goal User Login Tip SSO Integration would be ideal for proceeding with this document, but it is not required Users who login to the Aqua Console will be assigned a role which is assigned a permission set and can be bound to a specific application scope or be set to the Global application scope. Below is an illustration of how a user permission can look like. flowchart LR subgraph Login id1[\"Users\"] --> id2[\"Login\"] --> id3[\"Aqua Role Assignment\"] end subgraph Permissions & Access id3 --> id4[\"Permission Sets\"] id3 --> id5[\"Application Scope\"] end subgraph Resources id5 -- Global --> id6[\"All Resources\"] end subgraph Scoped Resources id5 -- Custom Application Scope --> id7[\"Scoped Resources\"] end Note Multiple application scopes can be assigned to an Aqua Role . Be careful on the addition of multiple Application Scopes , it may provide a user more access to resources they do not need to see. In the next few sections we will breakdown how it all pieces together to provide a user access to resources. We will start with application scopes to scope resources and view granularity, followed by permission sets to illustrate the possible permissions, and finally the Aqua Role describing the possible management of delegating access to resources leveraging an Aqua Role . Application Scopes Application Scopes are used to granularize access to specific resources within the environment. Application Scopes are broken down into 3 parts Artifacts Workloads Infrastructure These components breakdown the ecosystem into registries, running workloads, and clusters/VMs hosting the containers. For more information see the References section for application scopes Artifacts Artifacts grant the access to the container registries, repositories, and images that are configured within the Aqua Console . This section will focus on the image attribute of Artifacts . To access Application Scopes navigate to Administration > Application Scopes Click on Add Scope on the top right The configuration for the application scope will appear, enter the following: Name - Name of the Application Scope Description - Description of the scope, be it team or service, or groups of services Owner Email - Creator of the Application Scope Ensure the middle icon ( image ) is selected, there are two ways to scope access to repostories & images. Add the registry, this method will allow everything in the registry to be visible when the scope is assigned. Add the registry and include a repository , many repository , a specific image within a repository or many images within the repository Once the access is granted for the Artifacts section, we can move to Workloads and Infrastructure Workloads Workloads pertain to the running workloads within the environment, these can be scoped to kubernetes , enforcer group , and more. For additional details see Application Scopes under the Reference section. For the example we will be using Kubernetes as the Workloads attribute. Follow the first two steps from the Artifacts section to navigate to the application scope, configure the workload section. Similar to the Artifacts there are two ways to configure Workloads Add the cluster name only which will grant access to all namespaces Add the cluster name and one or more namespace names Note Multiple namespaces can be added to workloads, ensure that caution is taken when adding various namespaces. More access can accidentily be granted than intended Once the desired state is complete, we can move on to Infrastructure Infrastructure Infrastructure consists of a wide range of services, from Kubernetes to the Enforcer Group with different attributes such as subcription or account ID . or additional details see Application Scopes under the Reference section. For the example we will be using Kubernetes as the type. Add the same cluster that was used for Workloads Verify the cluster has been added Many clusters can be added to this scope if needed. Once this portion is completed we can review what the full Application Scope looks like in the next section. Completed Application Scope The Application Scope has been configured with Artifacts Workloads Infrastructure This completes the creation of the Application Scope . Permission Sets Permission sets provide the access to a given features or components within Aqua. They are broken down into 4 categories Policies Assets Compliance System Various roles can be created and granular permissions applied to narrow down what users have access to, this can also be scoped to provide access to both UI & API or simply the API Only This section will create a sample developer permission set to provide an example of granularity that can be achieved with permission sets. Important The role that will be created is a sample role, it may or may not be usable in your environment. Refer to your organizational policies when creating permission sets Use Case Create a developer role that will allow them to see vulnerabilities and Aqua Services To create permission sets : SaaS: Navigate to the Aqua menu on the top left and select Account Management Select Permission Sets and click on Add Permission Set Self-Hosted: Navigate to Administration > Access Management > click on the Permission Sets > Add Permission Set The name , description and if the permission set can be used by both UI & API or simply API Only . Name: demo_developer_permission_set Description: This permission set will allow developers to see vulnerabilities, workloads, and services Access Type: UI & API Permissions will be added for the following categories Policy Assets Compliance The following illustrates the permissions for each category and will be granted view permissions only. Policies Assets Compliance Permission Firewall Policies Dashboard Vulnerabilities View Risk Explorer CIS Benchmarks View Images View Enforcers View Containers View Services View The permissions show a count of enabled permissions for Edit , View Only , and permissions Not Set Policy Assets Compliance This completes the creation and permission assignments for the Permission Set . It can now be assigned to an Aqua Role Aqua Roles Aqua Roles are used to grant permissions to users or groups within the Aqua UI or API. They leverage permission sets to allocate permissions to resources and Aqua features. In this example an Aqua Role will be created and utilize the permission set created in the previous section Permission Sets Creating the Aqua Role SaaS: Navigate to the Aqua menu on the top left and select Account Management Under User Management , click on Roles and select Add Role Self-Hosted: Navigate to Administration > Access Management > click on the Roles > Add Role Once the screen changes to create the role , we will define the following: Name Description Permission Set Application Scope(s) Note Multiple Application Scopes can be added to a role, ensure that the Application Scopes created are well documented to ensure just enough access is granted for the organizational users The Aqua Role is created and now can be assigned to users! SSO Role Mapping Important SSO Integration must be completed and functional with assertions for users/groups being passed through prior to utilizing SSO Group Mapping The prerequisites for RBAC have been created with the Permission Sets , Aqua Roles , and Application Scopes . Users or groups can now be onboarded and scoped to the roles that will grant them access to their resources. Navigate to: SaaS: Navigate to the Aqua menu on the top left and select Account Management Under User Management , click on SSO Group Mapping To map a role select the Aqua Role to map to a Groups , and click Add The role will be in the table below showing it was successfully added Self-Hosted: Navigate to Administration > Integrations > click on the SSO Authentication > Role Mapping To map a role, start typing the name of the Aqua Role > type the Groups and click Add . Once completed click Save at the bottom of the page.

Aqua can block the deployment of containers based on images with security issues or no security status. Additionally, Aqua can enforce runtime parameters or exclude any drift or change to the container, from execution. Runtime Basics Runtime Policy components A container Runtime Policy consists of: Application scopes and Additional scope criteria: define set(s) of images to which the policy will be applied; see Policy Scope Status: indicates the status of the policy, if enabled or disabled at a system level Enforcement Mode: sets the mode of the policy, audit or enforce, and only takes enforcement effect when 'Enabled' and the Enforcer is in enforce as well. + Set Scheduler: configures a schedule to change the policy from audit to enforce in the number of days.

These limitations tend to exist due to the type of infrastructure used and the required component to support it.
